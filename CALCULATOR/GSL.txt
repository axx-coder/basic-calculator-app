Nepal
is a county where people struggle to fight face and then conquer. we diplomats here are discussing the political aspects that how to deal with the extraterritorial coercive measures, war has always led to brutal murders not more than that but we can surely deal it in another way, either politically or socially, but according to Nepal, 
affecting any countries economical aspect will not only disturb the ground section but all the section of the community, and this will pull their dignity off from them.
Nepal just wants to state that we all people are here in this room lets get to a consensus, which will get the community in the right direction and which will help the nation to grow in the
best way possible. for us humanitarian aspect is at the top rather than any war or cold war, I Delegate of Nepal request you all to get a positive conclusion which will help in a 
fruitful debate.
